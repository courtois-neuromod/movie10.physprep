# Courtois-NeuroMod: [Movie10 subdataset, physiological derivatives](https://github.com/courtois-neuromod/movie10.physprep) 

The [Courtois project on Neural Modelling (Courtois NeuroMod)](https://www.cneuromod.ca/) aims at training artificial neural networks using extensive experimental data on individual human brain activity and behaviour.

Participants performed task Movie10 while functional data being acquired in the MRI scanner. An extensive description can be found [here](https://docs.cneuromod.ca/en/latest/DATASETS.html#movie10).

This subdataset is organized following the [brain imaging data structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) (including extensions in development) and contains:
- [ ] [preprocessed neuroimaging data](https://docs.cneuromod.ca/en/latest/DERIVATIVES.html#fmriprep)
- [x] [preprocessed physiological data](https://docs.cneuromod.ca/en/latest/DERIVATIVES.html#physprep)
- [ ] behavioral variables in event files

*(unchecked are collected data which have not yet been integrated in the dataset)*

Courtois NeuroMod data are [freely shared with the scientific community](https://docs.cneuromod.ca/en/latest/ACCESS.html) to advance research at the interface of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Access to to the data is based on a registered access model, see the Courtois NeuroMod website for more information. Redistribution of data outside of the Courtois NeuroMod data bank is prohibited.
